# Findolo--Fifa-Data-Exploration-and-Insights-Generation-Project
The app is about FIFA Data Exploration and Insights Generation.
I chose this project because I am more familiar with data exploration, and It felt interesting and challenging.
The project is beneficial for football analysts to provide deep analysis of football players, their abilities, expenses, and their skills/experiences. This will help teams to select right players, getting the right combination of players, thus increasing the chances to win the game and perform well as a team.
